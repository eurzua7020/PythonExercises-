# PythonExercises-
Solving small problems in Python. Please feel free to use the code and improve it. 
I'm solving problems from the book "Exercises for Programmers 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills" by Brian P. Hogan. 
I will not be posting the questions. Just my answers. Great book to keep busy, definitely get it.
